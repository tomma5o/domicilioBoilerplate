# # Imola a Domicilio

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/ad921e79-fd5e-46a8-a3bf-b661e3d86dba/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/imoladomicilio/deploys)

> If you want to make the same proj for your city, the only thing I ask is to fork the [main repo](https://github.com/tomma5o/ferraraDomicilio) to make it yours.
> Thanks!

## Quick Start

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# test the production build locally
npm run serve
```

## How to

1. Change the specific label related to me and my city are inside the `.env` file, if you change that the js will be clean ;)
2. Change the city in the `template.html` file
3. Change the **name** and **short_name** inside `manifest.json`
4. Change the **name** inside `package.json`

## Data source

All the data are fetched from this gist:
https://gist.githubusercontent.com/tomma5o/1ca63d091b01a2fa6a73a17cc86b8fe6/raw/FerraraDomicilio.json

When you add your gist url remember to delete the last hash because points directly to a specific commit, otherwise you would get an outdated version, so for example:

```
remove the second hash ------------------------------------‚îê

https://gist.githubusercontent.com/tomma5o/<hash>/raw/<removeThisHash>/FerraraDomicilio.json
```
